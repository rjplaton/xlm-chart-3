# XLM Chart 3
Part three of my project to learn React through iteratively tackling data-visualization problems, culminating in publishing a React.js-based data visualization package.

This repo uses the React JS framework and the app will be served through a Heroku server.

Currently, it is using static values stored in json files but in the future will use real-time data from the [cryptocompare.com API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price&cat=SingleSymbolPriceEndpoint) and will be visualized using a horizontal bar chart.

The data shows XLM pairings to know how many XLM in exchange for 1 of a few common pairings including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), & US Dollar (USD).
